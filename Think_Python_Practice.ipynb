        "2.   Write a function named is_triangle that takes three integers as arguments, and that prints either \"Yes\" or \"No\", depending on whether you can or cannot form a triangle from sticks with the given lengths. Hint: Use a chained conditional.\n",
        "3.  What is the output of the program written? Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program when it prints the result.\n",
        "4.  Read the function and see if you can figure out what it does. Then run it and see if you got it right. Adjust the values of length, angle and factor and see what effect they have on the result. If you are not sure you understand how it works, try asking a virtual assistant.\n",

        "6.  As an example, ask a VA for a program that draws a SierpiÅ„ski triangle. The code you get should be a good starting place, but you might have to do some debugging. If the first attempt doesn't work, you can tell the VA what happened and ask for help -- or you can debug it yourself.\n",
